### HTML

- HTML has elements or "tags" <h1></h1>
- Theres usually a "pair" of tags, except for elements that cant have "children" like <img /> or <input />

### tags

```html
<div>: general wrapper element (by default display:block)

<span>: wrapper for some text (display:inline-block)

<img>: has a "src"

<header>

<main>

<a>: link with a "href" prop

<p>: paragraph
```

### form elements
```html
<form>: wraps around a bunch of inputs, and collects their data. It has an "onSubmit" prop

<input/>: can have a "type" of "text","number","checkbox","radio"

<button>: a button of type="submit" within a form will submit that form

<select>
```

### props??

There are built-in props, that are standard to HTML elements (like onClick, or value or src)... but you can also add custom props to your own elements

### React vs HTML

- React Elements (or "components") always start with an Uppercase letter

- React props are always camelCase, while in HTML they are all lowercase
